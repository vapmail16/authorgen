## 📁 New Folder Structure

```
data/
└── [author-name]/                 # One folder per author submission
    ├── data.csv                   # CSV with author data
    ├── author-images/             # Author photo folder
    │   └── author-photo.jpg      # Author's photo
    └── book-covers/               # Book covers folder
        ├── book1-cover.jpg       # Book 1 cover
        └── book2-cover.jpg       # Book 2 cover
```

---

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### When User Submits Form:

**1. You Receive:**
- Form submission with author data
- Author photo file
- Book cover image files

**2. You Create:**
```bash
data/
└── john-smith/
    ├── data.csv                  # Export from form
    ├── author-images/
    │   └── john-smith.jpg       # Photo they uploaded
    └── book-covers/
        ├── book1.jpg            # Cover images they uploaded
        └── book2.jpg
```

**3. CSV Contains Filenames (not URLs):**
```csv
Author Name,Author Photo,Book 1 - Cover Image,Book 2 - Cover Image
John Smith,john-smith.jpg,book1.jpg,book2.jpg
```

**4. You Generate:**
```bash
node generator.js data/john-smith 1
```

**5. You Get:**
```
generated-sites/john-smith-2025-10-12/
├── index.html
├── books.html
├── story.html
├── contact.html
└── assets/
    └── images/
        ├── john-smith.jpg      ← Automatically copied!
        ├── book1.jpg           ← Automatically copied!
        └── book2.jpg           ← Automatically copied!
```

## 📝 CSV Format Changes

### OLD Way (Still Works):
```csv
Author Photo URL (Optional),Book 1 - Cover Image URL
https://drive.google.com/open?id=abc123,https://drive.google.com/open?id=xyz789
```

### NEW Way (Recommended):
```csv
Author Photo,Book 1 - Cover Image
john-smith.jpg,book1-cover.jpg
```

**The system supports both!** Mix and match if needed.

---

## 🎯 Your Workflow

### Step 1: User Submits Form

They fill out the form and upload:
- ✅ Author information
- ✅ Author photo
- ✅ Book covers

### Step 2: You Organize Data

```bash
# Create folder structure
mkdir -p data/[author-name]/author-images
mkdir -p data/[author-name]/book-covers

# Save CSV as data.csv
# Copy author photo to author-images/
# Copy book covers to book-covers/
```

### Step 3: Generate Site

```bash
node generator.js data/[author-name] 1
```

### Step 4: Deploy

Drag generated folder to Netlify → Done!

## 🔍 Example Scenario

### User: Sarah Johnson

**She submits:**
- Name: Sarah Johnson
- Email: sarah@email.com
- Photo: `sarah_photo.jpg`
- Book 1: "Midnight Dreams" + `midnight_cover.jpg`
- Book 2: "Echoes" + `echoes_cover.jpg`

**You create:**
```
data/sarah-johnson/
├── data.csv
├── author-images/
│   └── sarah-johnson.jpg        ← Renamed from sarah_photo.jpg
└── book-covers/
    ├── midnight-dreams.jpg      ← Renamed from midnight_cover.jpg
    └── echoes.jpg               ← Renamed from echoes_cover.jpg
```

**CSV contains:**
```csv
Author Name,Author Photo,Book 1 - Title,Book 1 - Cover Image,Book 2 - Title,Book 2 - Cover Image
Sarah Johnson,sarah-johnson.jpg,Midnight Dreams,midnight-dreams.jpg,Echoes,echoes.jpg
```

**You generate:**
```bash
node generator.js data/sarah-johnson 1
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Site generated successfully!
📸 Copying author photo: sarah-johnson.jpg
📚 Copied 2 book cover(s)

Location: generated-sites/sarah-johnson-2025-10-12/

## ✅ Features

### What the Generator Does:

1. **Reads data folder** - Finds CSV and image folders
2. **Parses CSV** - Extracts author data
3. **Copies images** - Author photo + book covers → generated site
4. **Generates HTML** - All 4-5 pages with data
5. **Creates deployment-ready folder** - Everything self-contained

### What Gets Copied:

- ✅ All template assets (CSS, JS, icons)
- ✅ Author photo from `author-images/`
- ✅ Book covers from `book-covers/`
- ✅ Everything needed for deployment

### Smart Features:

- ✅ Detects missing images (shows warnings)
- ✅ Supports both filenames and URLs (backwards compatible)
- ✅ Auto-creates image directories
- ✅ Cleans up placeholder text from forms
- ✅ Hides empty sections automatically

---

## 🚦 Testing

### Test with Example Data:

```bash
# Example folder provided
node generator.js data/john-author 1
```

Currently shows warnings because no actual images exist, but:
- ✅ Structure is correct
- ✅ CSV parsing works
- ✅ Image paths are set correctly
- ✅ Site generates successfully

### Add Your Own Images:

```bash
# Add images to test
cp ~/some-photo.jpg data/john-author/author-images/john-photo.jpg
cp ~/book-cover.jpg data/john-author/book-covers/dark-mirror-cover.jpg

# Regenerate
node generator.js data/john-author 1

# You'll see:
# 📸 Copying author photo: john-photo.jpg
# 📚 Copied 1 book cover(s)
```

## 🎨 Image Requirements

### Author Photos

- **Size**: 800x800px or larger (square)
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WEBP
- **Naming**: Lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `john-smith.jpg`)

### Book Covers

- **Size**: 600x900px or larger (2:3 ratio)
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WEBP
- **Naming**: Descriptive (e.g., `book-title-cover.jpg`)

---

## 💡 Tips

### 1. Naming Convention

Use lowercase with hyphens:
- ✅ `john-smith.jpg`
- ✅ `midnight-dreams-cover.jpg`
- ❌ `John Smith.jpg` (spaces, capitals)
- ❌ `COVER.JPG` (all caps)

### 2. Organize by Author

Keep each author in their own folder:
```
data/
├── author-1/
├── author-2/
└── author-3/
```

### 3. Backup Data Folders

Data folders contain everything:
```bash
# Backup
tar -czf backup-2025-10-12.tar.gz data/

# Restore
tar -xzf backup-2025-10-12.tar.gz
```

### 4. Version Control

```bash
# Add to git
git add data/
git commit -m "Added new author: John Smith"
```

---

## 🔧 Commands Reference

### Generate from data folder
```bash

```

### Custom output

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if I don't have images yet?**  
A: Generator will show warnings but still create site. Images can be added later and regenerated.

**Q: Can I use URLs instead of local files?**  
A: Yes! System supports both. Use URLs in CSV if you prefer.

**Q: What happens to old sites generated with URLs?**  
A: They work exactly the same. Backwards compatible.

**Q: Can I mix URLs and filenames?**  
A: Yes! Author photo can be filename, book covers can be URLs (or vice versa).

**Q: Do I need to regenerate if I change images?**  
A: Yes. Replace image file and run generator again.

**Q: Where do images end up in generated site?**  
A: `generated-sites/[author]/assets/images/`

## 🎯 Summary

### Old Workflow:
1. Get form response with Google Drive URLs
2. Run generator (downloads from Drive)
3. Generated site has external image references

### New Workflow:
1. Get form response + image files
2. Organize in data folder
3. Run generator (copies local images)
